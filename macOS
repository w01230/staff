tccutil reset service
clears all current settings for the named service, or
tccutil reset service bundleID
clears the bundle identified by bundleID, e.g. co.eclecticlight.myApp, from the named service.

Named services currently include: Accessibility AddressBook AppleEvents (for Automation) Calendar Camera Microphone Photos Reminders All.
